# Separation properties of limits with affine transition maps

Let `D : I ⥤ Scheme` be a cofiltered diagram whose transition maps are affine, with limit cone
`c`. Mathlib shows that each projection `c.π.app i` is affine (`isAffineHom_π_app`) and that the
limit of quasi-compact schemes is quasi-compact (`Scheme.compactSpace_of_isLimit`). Since an
affine morphism is separated, separation and quasi-separation of a single member pass to the
limit (Stacks, Lemma 32.2.2 (01YX) with Morphisms, Lemma 29.11.2 (01S7)).

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.isSeparated_of_isLimit`: the limit is separated as soon as
  some member is.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.quasiSeparatedSpace_of_isLimit`: the limit is
  quasi-separated as soon as some member is.
