# Iterated restriction of topological representations

This file supplements Mathlib's restriction `TopRep.res φ` of a topological representation along a
monoid homomorphism `φ` with its behaviour under composition: restricting along `φ` and then along
`ψ` is restricting along `φ.comp ψ`, restricting along the identity does nothing, and so restricting
along a group isomorphism and then along its inverse gives the representation
back.

## Main results

* `TopRep.res_res`: `Res_ψ (Res_φ X) = Res_{φ ∘ ψ} X`.
* `TopRep.res_id`: `Res_id X = X`.
* `TopRep.res_symm_res`: `Res_{e⁻¹} (Res_e X) = X` for `e : H ≃* G`.

-- Not `@[simp]`: `res_res` already rewrites the left-hand side to a single restriction along
-- `(e : H →* G).comp e.symm`, so the simpNF linter rejects this lemma as a simp lemma.
