# The character of a Weyl module is a Schur polynomial

The Weyl module `𝕊^μ(kⁿ) = TauCeti.weylModuleOfShape k n μ` is the subrepresentation of
`(kⁿ)^{⊗|μ|}` cut out by a Young symmetrizer of the shape `μ`, and the classical statement about
its character is that on the diagonal torus `TauCeti.diagGL` it is the Schur polynomial of `μ`:

`char (𝕊^μ(kⁿ)) (diag t) = s_μ(t₀, …, t_{n-1})`.

Over a field of characteristic zero this file proves that identity for **every partition** `μ`
(`TauCeti.char_weylRepOfShape_diagramOf_diagonal`). The character of `𝕊^μ(kⁿ)` on the torus is
`(1 / d!) · ∑_{σ ∈ S_d} χ^μ(σ) · p_{ρ(σ)}`, the Specht character `χ^μ` weighting the power sums
over the cycle types (`TauCeti.char_weylRepOfShape_diagramOf_diagonal_eq_sum_spechtChar`), and
the inverse of Frobenius's formula (`TauCeti.sum_spechtChar_smul_psumPart`) identifies that
average with `s_μ`. Read at the identity element, the identity is a dimension count: the Weyl
module of `μ` has dimension the number of semistandard tableaux of shape `μ` with entries below
`n`.

The two extreme shapes — a shape with at most one row, and a shape with at most one column — are
also treated directly, indexed by Young diagrams against `TauCeti.diagramSchurPoly`: there the
Weyl module is a symmetric, respectively an exterior, power of the standard representation, and
its character is a complete homogeneous, respectively an elementary, symmetric polynomial.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.char_weylRepOfShape_diagramOf_diagonal` and its bundled form
  `TauCeti.char_weylFDRepOfShape_diagramOf_diagonal`: **the character of the Weyl module of a
  partition `μ` is the Schur polynomial `s_μ`** on the diagonal torus.
* `TauCeti.char_weylRepOfShape_diagonal_eq_eval_diagramSchurPoly` and
  `TauCeti.char_weylFDRepOfShape_diagonal_eq_eval_diagramSchurPoly`:
  the same formula for every Young diagram, expressed using `TauCeti.diagramSchurPoly`.
* `TauCeti.finrank_weylModuleOfShape`: **the dimension of the Weyl module of a Young diagram is
  the number of semistandard tableaux of its shape in the `n`-letter alphabet**, the value of its
  Schur polynomial at one.
* `TauCeti.char_weylRepOfShape_diagonal_of_colLen_le_one` and
  `TauCeti.char_weylRepOfShape_diagonal_of_rowLen_le_one`: the character of the Weyl module of a
  shape with at most one row, respectively at most one column, is the Schur polynomial of that
  shape, with `TauCeti.char_weylFDRepOfShape_diagonal_of_colLen_le_one` and
  `TauCeti.char_weylFDRepOfShape_diagonal_of_rowLen_le_one` their bundled forms.

The `k = ℂ` case of the bundled statements is the statement for `TauCeti.schurFunctor`, which is a
definitional re-export of `TauCeti.weylFDRepOfShape` over `ℂ`, so it needs no separate
declaration.
