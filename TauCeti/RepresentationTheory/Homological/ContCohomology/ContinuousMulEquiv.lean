# Continuous cohomology along an isomorphism of topological groups

For an isomorphism of topological groups `e : H ≃ₜ* G` and a topological representation `X` of
`G`, the compatible pair `(e, 𝟙)` induces an isomorphism

```text
Hⁿ(G, X) ≅ Hⁿ(H, Res_e X),
```

whose inverse is the compatible pair `(e⁻¹, 𝟙)`: restricting along `e` and then along `e⁻¹` gives
back `X` (`TopRep.res_symm_res`). This is how a cohomology group computed for one model of a
profinite group, such as an open subgroup of an absolute Galois group, is read for another, such as
the absolute Galois group of the corresponding finite extension.

## Main definitions

* `ContinuousMulEquiv.continuousCohomologyIso`: the isomorphism `Hⁿ(G, X) ≅ Hⁿ(H, Res_e X)`.

## Main results

* `ContinuousMulEquiv.continuousCohomologyIso_hom`,
  `ContinuousMulEquiv.continuousCohomologyIso_inv`: it is the map of the compatible pair
  `(e, 𝟙)`, with inverse that of `(e⁻¹, 𝟙)`.
* `ContinuousMulEquiv.natCard_continuousCohomology_res`: the two cohomology groups have the same
  cardinality.
