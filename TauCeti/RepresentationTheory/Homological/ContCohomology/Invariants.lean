# Invariants of a discrete module as a module over a finite quotient

For a normal subgroup `H` of `G` acting distributively on an additive group `M`, the invariants
`M ^ H` carry a distributive action of `G ⧸ H`. Over a profinite `G` with `H` open normal this is
the coefficient system of the finite-level tower computing continuous cohomology: the finite group
`G ⧸ H` acts on the discrete module `M ^ H`, and shrinking `H` enlarges `M ^ H` along transition
inclusions.

The invariant subgroup `M ^ H` is Mathlib's `FixedPoints.addSubgroup H M`; no second name for it is
introduced here, and its distributive `G`- and `G ⧸ H`-actions are the generic ones supplied by
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/GroupAction/FixedPoints.lean`, together with the generic transition
inclusions and coefficient-map functoriality. This file adds the two finite-level facts the tower
needs: directedness over the open normal subgroups and continuity of the quotient action.

The fixed-point functoriality and finite-level facts are first stated for an additive monoid with a
distributive `G`-action, then specialized to `FixedPoints.addSubgroup` for additive groups; an
abelian group gives the usual discrete-module theory. The topology classes are added only where
continuity is used, and no new bundling structure is introduced, so instance search composes the
unbundled classes freely.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.directed_fixedPoints_addSubmonoid` and
  `TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPointsAddSubmonoid`, with their additive-subgroup forms
  `TauCeti.directed_fixedPoints_addSubgroup` and `TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPoints`:
  the fixed points over the open normal subgroups form a directed family, and each carries a
  continuous action of the discrete quotient group.

## Roadmap

This file addresses the "Constructions" bullet of Layer 0 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ProfiniteCohomology/README.md`, which asks for the invariants `M ^ U` as a
`G ⧸ U`-module with their induced discrete action, together with that layer's API line for `M ^ U`:
the inclusions `M ^ U ↪ M ^ V` and `M ^ U ↪ M`, functoriality in `M` along equivariant maps and in
`U` along inclusions, and the edge cases at `⊥` and `⊤`. Milestones 2 and 3 of Layer 4's transition
system — the coefficient inclusion and its equivariance after restriction along the quotient
homomorphism — are exactly those Layer 0 items, supplied by the imported generic fixed-point API;
milestones 5 and 6 are the identity and composition laws of the *induced map on cohomology* and
need Layers 1 to 3, so the generic identity and composition laws are the coefficient-inclusion half
they will rest on.
The "Openness" bullet of Layer 0 lives in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Homological/ContCohomology/Discrete.lean` and is not restated here.
Directedness is what makes Layer 4's colimit over the finite quotients filtered.

/-- For an arbitrary normal subgroup `N` the action of `G ⧸ N` on the invariants `M ^ N` of a
discrete module with continuous `G`-action is continuous: the stabiliser of a point of `M ^ N` in
`G ⧸ N` pulls back along the quotient map to its stabiliser in `M`, which is open.

This is the coefficient continuity that inflation along `G → G ⧸ N` needs. It neither implies nor
follows from `TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPoints`, which reads the continuity off
discreteness of `G ⧸ U` for an **open** `U` and so needs no continuity of the `G`-action at all. -/
