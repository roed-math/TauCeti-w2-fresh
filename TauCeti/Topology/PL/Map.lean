# Piecewise-linear maps between real topological vector spaces

A map is *piecewise linear* — PL, and piecewise *affine* would be the more honest word — when it
is affine on each cell of a polyhedral decomposition of its domain. This file builds that
predicate in the shape the PL structure groupoid needs, and proves the closure properties which
make it a `Pregroupoid` property: restriction to a subset, locality, invariance under changing the
map off the set, and closure under composition.

## The shape of the definition

Two predicates are defined, one on top of the other.

* `TauCeti.IsPiecewiseAffineOn f V` says that `V` is covered by *finitely many* convex polyhedra
  (`TauCeti.IsConvexPolyhedron`) on each of which `f` agrees with a continuous affine map. This is
  the concrete, cell-by-cell notion.
* `TauCeti.IsPLOn f s` says that every point of `s` has a neighbourhood *in* `s` on which `f` is
  piecewise affine in the previous sense. This is the predicate the groupoid uses.

Both weakenings of the textbook notion of a polyhedral *subdivision* are deliberate, and are what
make the predicate usable as a `Pregroupoid` property on open subsets of a model space.

The cells are asked only to *cover* the set, not to be contained in it. A non-closed open subset of
a model space cannot be a locally finite union of the closed polyhedra used here, so a locally
finite subdivision *of* the set would not exist for the sets the groupoid quantifies over. The
covering form restricts to subsets for free (`TauCeti.IsPiecewiseAffineOn.mono`).

Finiteness is asked for only near each point. A piecewise-linear map may genuinely have infinitely
many pieces — a breakpoint at every integer, say — so a globally finite decomposition is not a
local condition, and `Pregroupoid.locality` demands one. Local finiteness is the textbook remedy,
and it implies the present predicate: a family that is locally finite along the set is, by
definition, finite on a small enough neighbourhood of each of the set's points.
`TauCeti.isPLOn_of_locallyFinite` records that implication, in this direction only — no converse
is proved, and none is claimed — and it is the bridge from a triangulation, which supplies exactly
such a family of affine pieces.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsPiecewiseAffineOn`: a finite polyhedral decomposition on whose cells the map is
  affine.
* `TauCeti.IsPLOn`: the localisation of the previous predicate, the piecewise-linear property.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isPiecewiseAffineOn_of_finite` and `TauCeti.isPLOn_of_locallyFinite`: the two
  constructors, from a cover indexed by an arbitrary finite type and from one that is locally
  finite along the set.
* `TauCeti.IsPLOn.continuousOn`: a piecewise-linear map is continuous. This is the "PL implies
  Top" content; the cells are closed and locally finite in number, so continuity is a pasting
  argument.
* `TauCeti.IsPLOn.mono`, `TauCeti.IsPLOn.congr`, `TauCeti.isPLOn_of_locally`,
  `TauCeti.IsPLOn.comp`: the four closure properties a `Pregroupoid` property must have.
* `ContinuousAffineMap.isPLOn_affineGraph`: the graph of a continuous affine map is piecewise
  affine on every subset of its domain.
* `TauCeti.isPLOn_abs` and `TauCeti.not_exists_continuousAffineMap_eq_abs`: the absolute value is
  piecewise linear and is not affine, so the predicate is strictly weaker than affineness.

This is part of the structure-group track of layer 1 of the geometric-topology roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology/README.md`); the groupoid built from it lives in
`TauCeti/Geometry/Manifold/PLGroupoid/Basic.lean`.
