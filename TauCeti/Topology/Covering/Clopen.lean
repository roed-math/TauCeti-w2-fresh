# Covering maps and clopen sets

A covering map `p : E → ↥s` onto a subspace of `X` is also a covering map `E → X` as soon as `s`
is clopen: over a point of `s` an evenly covered neighbourhood in `↥s` is one in `X` because `s`
is open, and over a point outside `s` the open set `sᶜ` has empty preimage, which
`IsEvenlyCovered.of_preimage_eq_empty` accepts as an evenly covered neighbourhood with empty
fibre.

Openness alone is not enough: for `s` open but not closed, a point of `frontier s` has every
neighbourhood meeting `s`, so no neighbourhood of it is evenly covered by a surjection onto `s`.
Mathlib's `IsCoveringMap` allows empty fibres, which is exactly what makes the clopen statement
work without assuming `p` surjective or `s = X`. In particular the inclusion of a clopen subset is
a covering map, so a covering map with finite fibres restricts to a covering map on every clopen
subset of its domain, such as a connected component of a locally connected total space.

The number of points in a fibre of a covering map is locally constant: an evenly covered
neighbourhood identifies the fibres over all of its points. So for any type `α`, the set of points
whose fibre is in bijection with `α` is clopen.

## Main declarations

* `IsCoveringMap.subtypeVal_comp`: the composite of a covering map onto a clopen
  subspace with the subspace inclusion is a covering map.
* `IsCoveringMap.domRestrict_of_isClopen`: the restriction of a covering map with finite fibres to a
  clopen subset of its domain is a covering map.
* `IsCoveringMap.isClopen_setOf_nonempty_fiber_equiv`: the points whose fibre is in bijection
  with a given type form a clopen set.
* `IsCoveringMap.nonempty_fiber_equiv`: over a preconnected base all fibres are in bijection, and
  `IsCoveringMap.surjective`: a covering map from a nonempty space onto a preconnected space is
  surjective.
