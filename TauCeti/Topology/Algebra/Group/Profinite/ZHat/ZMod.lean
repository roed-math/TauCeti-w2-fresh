# The profinite integers as the inverse limit of the `ZMod n`

The ring of profinite integers `Additive zHat` (see
`TauCeti.Topology.Algebra.Group.Profinite.ZHat.Ring`) projects onto every finite quotient
`ZMod n` of `ℤ`, and is determined by these projections: it is the inverse limit of the rings
`ZMod n` along the reduction maps `ZMod.castHom`. This file builds the projections and proves
that limit property, in the form of a universal property for additive and for ring
homomorphisms into `Additive zHat`.

The projection `zHat.toZMod n` is the continuous homomorphism `zHat.lift (ofAdd 1)` into the
finite discrete group `Multiplicative (ZMod n)`, read additively; it is a ring homomorphism for
the product of `Additive zHat`, and the projections are compatible along divisibility
(`zHat.cast_toZMod`). Every open normal subgroup of `zHat` contains the kernel of some
projection (`zHat.exists_monoidHom_mk_eq_toZMod`), so two profinite integers with the same
projections are equal (`zHat.ext_of_toZMod`), a map into the profinite integers is continuous as
soon as its projections are (`zHat.continuous_iff_forall_continuous_toZMod`), and a compatible
family of residues is realized by a unique profinite integer
(`zHat.existsUnique_forall_toZMod_eq`). The last statement assembles a compatible family of
additive homomorphisms `A →+ ZMod n` into a unique additive homomorphism
`zHat.addLift f : A →+ Additive zHat`, continuous when every member of the family is. A compatible
family of ring homomorphisms `R →+* ZMod n` assembles in the same way into a unique ring
homomorphism `zHat.ringLift f : R →+* Additive zHat`, whose underlying additive homomorphism is the
additive lift of the family. The integers embed into the profinite integers: `Additive zHat` has
characteristic zero.

The index `n` of the finite levels runs over `ℕ+`: for `n = 0` the group `Multiplicative (ZMod 0)`
is `ℤ`, which is not profinite, and no lift exists.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.zHat.toZMod`: reduction of a profinite integer modulo `n`, a continuous ring
  homomorphism `Additive zHat →+* ZMod n`.
* `TauCeti.zHat.addLift`: the additive homomorphism into `Additive zHat` assembled from a
  compatible family of additive homomorphisms into the `ZMod n`.
* `TauCeti.zHat.ringLift`: the ring homomorphism into `Additive zHat` assembled from a compatible
  family of ring homomorphisms into the `ZMod n`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.zHat.cast_toZMod`, `TauCeti.zHat.castHom_comp_toZMod`: the projections are compatible
  along divisibility.
* `TauCeti.zHat.ext_of_toZMod`, `TauCeti.zHat.ext_iff_toZMod`,
  `TauCeti.zHat.existsUnique_forall_toZMod_eq`: a profinite integer is determined by its
  projections, and every compatible family of residues comes from one.
* `TauCeti.zHat.toZMod_addLift`, `TauCeti.zHat.addLift_unique`,
  `TauCeti.zHat.continuous_addLift`: the universal property of `Additive zHat` as the inverse
  limit of the groups `ZMod n`.
* `TauCeti.zHat.toZMod_ringLift`, `TauCeti.zHat.ringLift_unique`,
  `TauCeti.zHat.continuous_ringLift`: the universal property of `Additive zHat` as the inverse
  limit of the rings `ZMod n`; `TauCeti.zHat.coe_addMonoidHom_ringLift` compares it with the
  additive one.
* `TauCeti.zHat.continuous_iff_forall_continuous_toZMod`: continuity into `Additive zHat` is
  detected by the projections.
* The `CharZero (Additive zHat)` instance and `TauCeti.zHat.ofInt_injective`: the integers embed
  into the profinite integers.
