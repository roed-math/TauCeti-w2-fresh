# The fixed field in the finite-quotient Shapiro argument

Let `V` be an open normal subgroup of the absolute Galois group `G_F` and let `C` be a subgroup of
the finite quotient `G_F / V`. The subgroup of `G_F` relevant to Shapiro's lemma is the preimage
of `C`. This file constructs its fixed field `shapiroField F V C` and proves

```text
[shapiroField F V C : F] = [G_F / V : C].
```

Consequently, induction from `C` multiplies both dimension and the exponent in the cardinality of
a finite-vector-space coefficient module by this field degree. The degree formula in a scalar
tower gives the arithmetic factor used in the local Euler-characteristic argument.

The cohomological comparison itself is
`ContinuousCohomology.indInflationShapiroIso`; this file supplies its fixed-field and coefficient-
size interpretation.

## Main definitions

* `shapiroOpenSubgroup`: the preimage of `C` in `G_F`.
* `shapiroField`: the fixed field of that preimage in an algebraic closure of `F`.
* `shapiroFieldEmbedding`: its inclusion into the separable closure `Fˢ`.

## Main results

* `fixingSubgroup_shapiroField`: the Shapiro fixed field is fixed exactly by the preimage of `C`.
* `finrank_shapiroField`: the fixed-field degree is the index of `C`.
* `range_absoluteGaloisGroupExtend_shapiroFieldEmbedding`: the absolute Galois group of the
  Shapiro fixed field, embedded in `G_F` along `shapiroFieldEmbedding`, is the preimage of `C`.
* `finrank_ind_eq_finrank_shapiroField_mul`: induction scales coefficient dimension by that degree.
* `natCard_ind_eq_pow_finrank_shapiroField_mul`: the corresponding coefficient-cardinality
  formula over a prime field.
* `finrank_base_shapiroField`: the degree formula in a finite scalar tower.
* `finrank_base_mul_finrank_ind_eq_shapiroField`: the equality of arithmetic exponents on the two
  sides of Shapiro's lemma.
