# Finite-dimensional and path laws of a process

For a process `X : ℕ → Ω → α` on a measure space `(Ω, μ)`, this file defines its laws as measures
on finite tuples and on path space `ℕ → α`, together with the elementary path-space maps used to
compare them:

* `blockLaw μ X k` — the law of the finite selection `(X (k 0), …, X (k (m - 1)))`, for an
  arbitrary index type;
* `prefixLaw μ X n` — the law of the first `n` coordinates;
* `pathLaw μ X` — the law of the whole path `ω ↦ (i ↦ X i ω)`;
* `blockLaw_congr`, `prefixLaw_congr`, `pathLaw_congr` — invariance of these laws under
  coordinatewise almost-everywhere equality;
* `prefixProj α n`, `shift α`, `permReindex π` — the prefix projection, the one-sided left shift,
  and reindexing by a permutation of time;
* `prefixSplitEquiv r` — the measurable equivalence splitting a path into its length-`r` prefix
  and its tail from index `r`.

The definitions are hypothesis-light; measurability hypotheses enter only in the lemmas that
compose `Measure.map`s (`map_prefixProj_pathLaw`, `map_blockLaw`, `map_reindex_pathLaw`, …).
Nothing here mentions a symmetry of the process: the exchangeability predicates built on these
laws live in `TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.Basic`.

The laws and path-space maps are adapted from the `cameronfreer/exchangeability` sources pinned
at `e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`, with Tau Ceti API names and hypotheses;
`prefixSplitEquiv` is not taken from those sources.
