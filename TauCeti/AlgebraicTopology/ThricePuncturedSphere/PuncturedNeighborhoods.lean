# Standard punctured neighborhoods of the three punctures

This file fixes pairwise disjoint standard neighborhoods of the punctures `0`, `1`, and `∞` in
the thrice-punctured sphere. In the affine coordinate they are

* `puncturedNeighborhoodZero = {z | ‖z‖ < 1 / 2}`;
* `puncturedNeighborhoodOne = {z | ‖z - 1‖ < 1 / 2}`;
* `puncturedNeighborhoodInf = {z | 2 < ‖z‖}`.

The missing center of each finite disc is already excluded from `ThricePuncturedSphere`. The
anharmonic maps `z ↦ 1 - z` and `z ↦ 1 / z` identify the neighborhoods at `1` and `∞` with the
one at `0`. Thus all three are copies of the same punctured disc, expressed in the standard
local coordinates at the three punctures.

These neighborhoods are the local geometric input for extending a finite cover across the three
punctures: their pairwise disjointness lets the three fillings be performed independently.

## Main definitions

* `puncturedDiscOneHalf`: the punctured complex disc of radius `1 / 2`.
* `puncturedNeighborhoodZero`, `puncturedNeighborhoodOne`, `puncturedNeighborhoodInf`: the
  three standard neighborhoods.
* `puncturedNeighborhoodZeroHomeomorphPuncturedDiscOneHalf`,
  `puncturedNeighborhoodOneHomeomorphPuncturedDiscOneHalf`, and
  `puncturedNeighborhoodInfHomeomorphPuncturedDiscOneHalf`: their standard local coordinates.
* `puncturedDiscOneHalfHomeomorphPuncturedDisc`: multiplication by `2`, from the disc of radius
  `1 / 2` to the punctured unit disc `ball 0 1 \ {0}` that carries the power-map covers.
